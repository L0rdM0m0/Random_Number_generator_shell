How to run the script in MAC or Linux.
Shell or python, make sure you use the correct #shebang so the the kernel knows which interpreter to use. So you don't have to specify when runnng the script.

Linux 
    Shell - Make sure the file has correct executable permissions and run the file by using ./filename.sh or /full/path/filename.sh
    Python - Makesure, python is installed in the system, and given executable permissions to the file. Run by ./filename.py or /full/path/filename.py

Mac 
    Shell - Same way as Linux, make sure the file has correct executable permissions and run the file by using ./filename.sh or /full/path/filename.sh 
    Python - Same way as Linux, make sure the file has correct executable permissions and run the file by using ./filename.py or /full/path/filename.py
